# Jurisdiction

"{" <ISO 3166-1> [[ "." | ":"] <state or province> [ "." | ":" <county | district> ]]] [["§" <legislation & year [- <pinhole>]]  "}"

The distinction is that "." lower level is subordinate to higher whereas ":" is strongly precedent but not binding, mostly seen in commonwealth. There's a carveout provision "^" which are exemptions such as Waitangi Treaty provisions or native American reservations which are legally distinct. Where there is no named district a geometric shape may be placeholder.
